# Cloud-Based Analytics Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project is a **Cloud-Based Analytics Dashboard** designed to provide insights and predictive analysis on **traffic accident statistics and patterns**. The system integrates multiple **cloud technologies**, **machine learning models**, and **data visualization tools** to enable real-time decision-making.  

## Motivation  
With the increasing **volume of data** in transportation and safety analysis, organizations need **scalable, real-time solutions** to analyze and interpret critical insights. This project addresses challenges such as:  
- **Scalability** and cost-efficiency  
- **Data processing and storage** in cloud environments  
- **Predictive modeling** for accident severity classification  

## Features  
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Provides visual insights into traffic accident data  
- **Predictive Analysis**: Implements a **Random Forest Classifier** to assess accident severity  
- **Cloud-Based Architecture**: Utilizes **Google Cloud BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and AI Platform**  
- **Modern Web Technologies**: Built using **React, Flask, and Google Cloud Services**  

## Tech Stack  
### Backend:  
- **Python** (logic implementation)  
- **Flask** (web framework)  
- **Google Cloud BigQuery** (data warehousing)  

### Frontend:  
- **React** (user interface)  
- **JavaScript & CSS** (frontend development)  
- **Axios** (API request handling)  

### Deployment & Tools:  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**  
- **Docker** (containerization)  
- **CORS & Proxy Configuration** (backend-frontend integration)  

## Architecture  
The project follows a structured pipeline:  
1. **Data Collection & Storage**: Importing datasets into **Google Cloud Storage** and processing them in **BigQuery**.  
2. **Database Implementation**: Optimizing schema and structuring key attributes for analysis.  
3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Training a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict accident severity.  
4. **Frontend Development**: Creating an intuitive UI with **React**.  
5. **Deployment & Testing**: Overcoming challenges in **cross-domain requests** and **frontend-backend integration**.  

## Results  
- Successfully developed a functional **cloud-hosted analytics dashboard**  
- Enhanced **predictive modeling** using **machine learning**  
- Demonstrated **scalability and performance reliability** through tests  

## Future Improvements  
- **Optimize cloud deployment** to enhance real-time processing  
- **Integrate AI models** for live traffic analysis  
- **Refine UI/UX** for improved user experience  
- **Ensure continuous updates** for better scalability
